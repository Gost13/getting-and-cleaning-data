getting-and-cleaning-data
=========================

Source repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data course in Coursera.org

In this repository you will find the following files:

* `README.md`: this file
* `run_analysis.R`: Script written in R which cleans and summarizes the data found in [this data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). Details below.
* `tidy_data.txt`: The data generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.
* `CodeBook.md`: Markdown file explaining the contents of the `tidy_data.txt` file as well as the manipulations performed to generate it.

run_analysis.R
-------------------
This R script generates the `tidy_data.txt` file from the contents of [this data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

In order to make it work, please make sure that the linked zip file has been downloaded and extracted inside the working directory.
Once this has been done, the file `run_analysis.R` can be source from within any R environment, and then the function `run_analysis()` can be run, without any parameter.
This will load all the required data from the unzipped folder, perform the necessary manipulations and finally generate the `tidy_data.txt` file inside the same folder.

For further details about the exact manipulations performed on the data, please refer to the file `CodeBook.md`.
